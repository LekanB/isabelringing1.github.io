	<p>Hi! My name is Isabel Lee. I am a programmer, a writer, an artist, and an engineer. But most of all, I'm a student, and I love to learn about everything. One of the things I love the most is Virtual Reality. You can see all the cool stuff I've done in my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>.
	<br><br>
	Currently, I'm a junior at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy in Aurora, Illinois. This probably goes without saying, but I do a lot of math and science. How much, you ask? Well, you can read all about that in my <a href="/resume">resume</a> if you're curious!
	<br><br>
	Since I'm only in high school, I suppose my biography up to this point is a bit short. However, I'm looking forward to being a part of great things.
