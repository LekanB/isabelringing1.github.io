      <strong>Demos</strong><br>
      A long time ago when I was in middle school, I started to work on an interactive <br>
      visual game called ANIRA. As of now, it's never quite been completed and I've moved <br>
      on to other things. But if you're curious, I've compiled a short demo reel of what I<br>
      had accomplished in the year or so I worked on it!<br>
