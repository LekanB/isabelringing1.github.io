      <strong>Demos</strong><br>
      Vestal <br>
      Vestal is a buisness concept I pitched to investors at the 2016 Power Pitch Competition at the Illinois <br>
      Mathematics and Science Academy. The idea was a virtual-reality based social network where you could <br>
      interact with others using just a Google Cardboard Viewer and a smartphone.
      <br> <br>
      In addition to a full-length investor pitch, I also had the opportunity to pitch my idea in a matter <br>
      of seconds to many people. An aid I used was a quick demo on a Galazy S5 that showed the capabilities of what<br>
      Virtual Reality and Vestal could do. A video of the demo is below. <br>

      ANIRA <br>
      A long time ago, when I was in middle school, I started to work on an interactive <br>
      visual game called ANIRA. The basic premise was that an old man searches for his wife <br>
      with the help of the girl he's babysitting, and ends up discovering some dark secrets <br>
      that drastically change his life. As of now, it's never quite been completed and I've moved <br>
      on to other things. But if you're curious, I've compiled a short demo reel of what I<br>
      had accomplished so far!<br>
